A latex template for writing a UCL PhD thesis.  All efforts have been made to
make sure this template conforms to the UCL thesis formatting guidlines which
can be found here:

http://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/research_degrees/thesis_formatting

Usage
=====

All file that a user should normally edit are predixed with user_.  Each of
these files contains a description of what is to go in it, but they're mostly
self explanatory.

All files not prefixed with user_ can be though of as being the template
itself.  This also means that they are covered by the license and should be
shared if they are modified as per the licence agreement.  Conversely all user_
files belong to the user and are do not fall under the license of the template.

License
=======

The template is licensed under the GPL-v2 license (see LICENSE for full terms).
This license was used instead of a creative commons style license to reflect
the fact that the template itself is covered by the license but no used added
content (i.e. the end user's thesis) is.
